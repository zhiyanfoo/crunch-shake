Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black : ["Enter - ['BERTRAM', 'COUNTESS', 'HELENA', 'LAFEU', 'all']"] : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband. : None
BERTRAM
1.1 :And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death : None
1.1 :anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to : None
1.1 :whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, : None
1.1 :sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times : None
1.1 :good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose : None
1.1 :worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather : None
1.1 :than lack it where there is such abundance. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :What hope is there of his majesty's amendment? : None
LAFEU
1.1 :He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose : None
1.1 :practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and : None
1.1 :finds no other advantage in the process but only the : None
1.1 :losing of hope by time. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that : None
1.1 :'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was : None
1.1 :almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so : None
1.1 :far, would have made nature immortal, and death : None
1.1 :should have play for lack of work. Would, for the : None
1.1 :king's sake, he were living! I think it would be : None
1.1 :the death of the king's disease. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :How called you the man you speak of, madam? : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was : None
1.1 :his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very : None
1.1 :lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he : None
1.1 :was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge : None
1.1 :could be set up against mortality. : None
BERTRAM
1.1 :What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of? : None
LAFEU
1.1 :A fistula, my lord. : None
BERTRAM
1.1 :I heard not of it before. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman : None
1.1 :the daughter of Gerard de Narbon? : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my : None
1.1 :overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that : None
1.1 :her education promises; her dispositions she : None
1.1 :inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where : None
1.1 :an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there : None
1.1 :commendations go with pity; they are virtues and : None
1.1 :traitors too; in her they are the better for their : None
1.1 :simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :Your commendations, madam, get from her tears. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise : None
1.1 :in. The remembrance of her father never approaches : None
1.1 :her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all : None
1.1 :livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; : None
1.1 :go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect : None
1.1 :a sorrow than have it. : None
HELENA
1.1 :I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, : None
1.1 :excessive grief the enemy to the living. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess : None
1.1 :makes it soon mortal. : None
BERTRAM
1.1 :Madam, I desire your holy wishes. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :How understand we that? : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father : None
1.1 :In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue : None
1.1 :Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness : None
1.1 :Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few, : None
1.1 :Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy : None
1.1 :Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend : None
1.1 :Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence, : None
1.1 :But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will, : None
1.1 :That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, : None
1.1 :Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord; : None
1.1 :'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, : None
1.1 :Advise him. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :          He cannot want the best : None
1.1 :That shall attend his love. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : COUNTESS
BERTRAM
1.1 :  The best wishes that can be forged in : To HELENA : ["To - ['HELENA']"] : BERTRAM
1.1 :your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable : None
1.1 :to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of : None
1.1 :your father. : None
Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU : ["Exeunt - ['BERTRAM', 'LAFEU']"] : LAFEU
HELENA
1.1 :O, were that all! I think not on my father; : None
1.1 :And these great tears grace his remembrance more : None
1.1 :Than those I shed for him. What was he like? : None
1.1 :I have forgot him: my imagination : None
1.1 :Carries no favour in't but Bertram's. : None
1.1 :I am undone: there is no living, none, : None
1.1 :If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one : None
1.1 :That I should love a bright particular star : None
1.1 :And think to wed it, he is so above me: : None
1.1 :In his bright radiance and collateral light : None
1.1 :Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. : None
1.1 :The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: : None
1.1 :The hind that would be mated by the lion : None
1.1 :Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague, : None
1.1 :To see him every hour; to sit and draw : None
1.1 :His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, : None
1.1 :In our heart's table; heart too capable : None
1.1 :Of every line and trick of his sweet favour: : None
1.1 :But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy : None
1.1 :Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here? : None
Enter PAROLLES : ["Enter - ['PAROLLES']"] : HELENA
Aside : ['Aside - []'] : HELENA
1.1 :One that goes with him: I love him for his sake; : None
1.1 :And yet I know him a notorious liar, : None
1.1 :Think him a great way fool, solely a coward; : None
1.1 :Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him, : None
1.1 :That they take place, when virtue's steely bones : None
1.1 :Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see : None
1.1 :Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Save you, fair queen! : None
HELENA
1.1 :And you, monarch! : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :No. : None
HELENA
1.1 :And no. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Are you meditating on virginity? : None
HELENA
1.1 :Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me : None
1.1 :ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how : None
1.1 :may we barricado it against him? : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Keep him out. : None
HELENA
1.1 :But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, : None
1.1 :in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some : None
1.1 :warlike resistance. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :There is none: man, sitting down before you, will : None
1.1 :undermine you and blow you up. : None
HELENA
1.1 :Bless our poor virginity from underminers and : None
1.1 :blowers up! Is there no military policy, how : None
1.1 :virgins might blow up men? : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be : None
1.1 :blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with : None
1.1 :the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It : None
1.1 :is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to : None
1.1 :preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational : None
1.1 :increase and there was never virgin got till : None
1.1 :virginity was first lost. That you were made of is : None
1.1 :metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost : None
1.1 :may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is : None
1.1 :ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't! : None
HELENA
1.1 :I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the : None
1.1 :rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity, : None
1.1 :is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible : None
1.1 :disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: : None
1.1 :virginity murders itself and should be buried in : None
1.1 :highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate : None
1.1 :offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, : None
1.1 :much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very : None
1.1 :paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. : None
1.1 :Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of : None
1.1 :self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the : None
1.1 :canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose : None
1.1 :by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make : None
1.1 :itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the : None
1.1 :principal itself not much the worse: away with 't! : None
HELENA
1.1 :How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it : None
1.1 :likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with : None
1.1 :lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't : None
1.1 :while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. : None
1.1 :Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out : None
1.1 :of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just : None
1.1 :like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not : None
1.1 :now. Your date is better in your pie and your : None
1.1 :porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, : None
1.1 :your old virginity, is like one of our French : None
1.1 :withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, : None
1.1 :'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; : None
1.1 :marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it? : None
HELENA
1.1 :Not my virginity yet [         ] : None
1.1 :There shall your master have a thousand loves, : None
1.1 :A mother and a mistress and a friend, : None
1.1 :A phoenix, captain and an enemy, : None
1.1 :A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, : None
1.1 :A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear; : None
1.1 :His humble ambition, proud humility, : None
1.1 :His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, : None
1.1 :His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world : None
1.1 :Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms, : None
1.1 :That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-- : None
1.1 :I know not what he shall. God send him well! : None
1.1 :The court's a learning place, and he is one-- : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :What one, i' faith? : None
HELENA
1.1 :That I wish well. 'Tis pity-- : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :What's pity? : None
HELENA
1.1 :That wishing well had not a body in't, : None
1.1 :Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born, : None
1.1 :Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, : None
1.1 :Might with effects of them follow our friends, : None
1.1 :And show what we alone must think, which never : None
1.1 :Return us thanks. : None

PAROLLES
1.1 :Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I : None
1.1 :will think of thee at court. : None
HELENA
1.1 :Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Under Mars, I. : None
HELENA
1.1 :I especially think, under Mars. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Why under Mars? : None
HELENA
1.1 :The wars have so kept you under that you must needs : None
1.1 :be born under Mars. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :When he was predominant. : None
HELENA
1.1 :When he was retrograde, I think, rather. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Why think you so? : None
HELENA
1.1 :You go so much backward when you fight. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :That's for advantage. : None
HELENA
1.1 :So is running away, when fear proposes the safety; : None
1.1 :but the composition that your valour and fear makes : None
1.1 :in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee : None
1.1 :acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the : None
1.1 :which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize : None
1.1 :thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's : None
1.1 :counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon : None
1.1 :thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and : None
1.1 :thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When : None
1.1 :thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast : None
1.1 :none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband, : None

1.1 :To join like likes and kiss like native things. : None
1.1 :Impossible be strange attempts to those : None
1.1 :That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose : None
1.1 :What hath been cannot be: who ever strove : None
1.1 :So show her merit, that did miss her love? : None

First Lord
1.2 :                  So 'tis reported, sir. : None
KING
1.2 :Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it : None
1.2 :A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria, : None
1.2 :With caution that the Florentine will move us : None
1.2 :For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend : None
1.2 :Prejudicates the business and would seem : None
1.2 :To have us make denial. : None
First Lord
1.2 :His love and wisdom, : None
1.2 :Approved so to your majesty, may plead : None

1.2 :Young Bertram. : None
KING
1.2 :                  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face; : None
1.2 :Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, : None

BERTRAM
1.2 :My thanks and duty are your majesty's. : None
KING
1.2 :I would I had that corporal soundness now, : None
1.2 :As when thy father and myself in friendship : None
1.2 :First tried our soldiership! He did look far : None
1.2 :Into the service of the time and was : None
1.2 :Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long; : None
1.2 :But on us both did haggish age steal on : None
1.2 :And wore us out of act. It much repairs me : None
1.2 :To talk of your good father. In his youth : None
1.2 :He had the wit which I can well observe : None
1.2 :To-day in our young lords; but they may jest : None
1.2 :Till their own scorn return to them unnoted : None
1.2 :Ere they can hide their levity in honour; : None
1.2 :So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness : None
1.2 :Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were, : None
1.2 :His equal had awaked them, and his honour, : None
1.2 :Clock to itself, knew the true minute when : None
1.2 :Exception bid him speak, and at this time : None
1.2 :His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him : None
1.2 :He used as creatures of another place : None
1.2 :And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks, : None
1.2 :Making them proud of his humility, : None
1.2 :In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man : None
1.2 :Might be a copy to these younger times; : None

BERTRAM
1.2 :His good remembrance, sir, : None

KING
1.2 :Would I were with him! He would always say-- : None
1.2 :Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words : None

DIANA
3.5 :They say the French count has done most honourable service. : None
Widow
3.5 :It is reported that he has taken their greatest : None

MARIANA
3.5 :Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with : None
3.5 :the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this : None

3.5 :no legacy is so rich as honesty. : None
Widow
3.5 :I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited : None
3.5 :by a gentleman his companion. : None
MARIANA
3.5 :I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a : None
3.5 :filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the : None
3.5 :young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises, : None
3.5 :enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of : None
3.5 :lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid : None
3.5 :hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, : None
3.5 :example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of : None
3.5 :maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, : None

3.5 :I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, : None
3.5 :though there were no further danger known but the : None

DIANA
3.5 :Whatsome'er he is, : None

HELENA
3.5 :Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady. : None

3.5 :In argument of praise, or to the worth : None
3.5 :Of the great count himself, she is too mean : None

Second Lord
3.6 :Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his : None

First Lord
3.6 :If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no : None
3.6 :more in your respect. : None
Second Lord
3.6 :On my life, my lord, a bubble. : None
BERTRAM
3.6 :Do you think I am so far deceived in him? : None
Second Lord
3.6 :Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, : None
3.6 :without any malice, but to speak of him as my : None
3.6 :kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and : None
3.6 :endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner : None
3.6 :of no one good quality worthy your lordship's : None
3.6 :entertainment. : None
First Lord
3.6 :It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in : None
3.6 :his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some : None
3.6 :great and trusty business in a main danger fail you. : None
BERTRAM
3.6 :I would I knew in what particular action to try him. : None
First Lord
3.6 :None better than to let him fetch off his drum, : None
3.6 :which you hear him so confidently undertake to do. : None
Second Lord
3.6 :I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly : None
3.6 :surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he : None
3.6 :knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink : None
3.6 :him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he : None
3.6 :is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when : None
3.6 :we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship : None
3.6 :present at his examination: if he do not, for the : None
3.6 :promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of : None
3.6 :base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the : None
3.6 :intelligence in his power against you, and that with : None
3.6 :the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never : None
3.6 :trust my judgment in any thing. : None
First Lord
3.6 :O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; : None
3.6 :he says he has a stratagem for't: when your : None
3.6 :lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to : None
3.6 :what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be : None
3.6 :melted, if you give him not John Drum's : None
3.6 :entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. : None
3.6 :Here he comes. : None
Enter PAROLLES : ["Enter - ['PAROLLES']"] : First Lord
Second Lord

BERTRAM
3.6 :How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your : None
3.6 :disposition. : None
First Lord
3.6 :A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum. : None
PAROLLES
3.6 :'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost! : None
3.6 :There was excellent command,--to charge in with our : None
3.6 :horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers! : None
First Lord
3.6 :That was not to be blamed in the command of the : None
3.6 :service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar : None
3.6 :himself could not have prevented, if he had been : None
3.6 :there to command. : None
BERTRAM
3.6 :Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some : None
3.6 :dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is : None
3.6 :not to be recovered. : None
PAROLLES
3.6 :It might have been recovered. : None
BERTRAM
3.6 :It might; but it is not now. : None
PAROLLES
3.6 :It is to be recovered: but that the merit of : None
3.6 :service is seldom attributed to the true and exact : None
3.6 :performer, I would have that drum or another, or : None
3.6 :'hic jacet.' : None
BERTRAM
3.6 :Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you : None
3.6 :think your mystery in stratagem can bring this : None
3.6 :instrument of honour again into his native quarter, : None
3.6 :be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will : None
3.6 :grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you : None
3.6 :speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it. : None
3.6 :and extend to you what further becomes his : None
3.6 :greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your : None
3.6 :worthiness. : None

3.6 :I'll about it this evening: and I will presently : None
3.6 :pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my : None
3.6 :certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; : None
3.6 :and by midnight look to hear further from me. : None
BERTRAM
3.6 :May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it? : None
PAROLLES
3.6 :I know not what the success will be, my lord; but : None
3.6 :the attempt I vow. : None
BERTRAM

3.6 :strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems : None
3.6 :to undertake this business, which he knows is not to : None
3.6 :be done; damns himself to do and dares better be : None
3.6 :damned than to do't? : None
First Lord
3.6 :You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it : None
3.6 :is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and : None
3.6 :for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but : None
3.6 :when you find him out, you have him ever after. : None
BERTRAM
3.6 :Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of : None
3.6 :this that so seriously he does address himself unto? : None
Second Lord
3.6 :None in the world; but return with an invention and : None
3.6 :clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we : None
3.6 :have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall : None
3.6 :to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect. : None
First Lord
3.6 :We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case : None
3.6 :him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu: : None
3.6 :when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a : None

First Lord
3.6 :But you say she's honest. : None
BERTRAM
3.6 :That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once : None
3.6 :And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her, : None
3.6 :By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind, : None
3.6 :Tokens and letters which she did re-send; : None

HELENA
3.7 :Nor would I wish you. : None
3.7 :First, give me trust, the count he is my husband, : None

3.7 :Take this purse of gold, : None
3.7 :And let me buy your friendly help thus far, : None

3.7 :Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent, : None

3.7 :That downward hath succeeded in his house : None
3.7 :From son to son, some four or five descents : None

Widow

3.7 :In fine, delivers me to fill the time, : None
3.7 :Herself most chastely absent: after this, : None
3.7 :To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns : None

Widow
3.7 :I have yielded: : None
3.7 :Instruct my daughter how she shall persever, : None

4.2 :At least in my opinion. : None
BERTRAM
4.2 :Change it, change it; : None
4.2 :Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy; : None

First Lord
4.3 :You have not given him his mother's letter? : None
Second Lord
4.3 :I have delivered it an hour since: there is : None
4.3 :something in't that stings his nature; for on the : None
4.3 :reading it he changed almost into another man. : None
First Lord
4.3 :He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking : None
4.3 :off so good a wife and so sweet a lady. : None
Second Lord
4.3 :Especially he hath incurred the everlasting : None
4.3 :displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his : None

4.3 :thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you. : None
First Lord
4.3 :When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the : None
4.3 :grave of it. : None
Second Lord
4.3 :He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in : None
4.3 :Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he : None
4.3 :fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath : None
4.3 :given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself : None
4.3 :made in the unchaste composition. : None
First Lord
4.3 :Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, : None
4.3 :what things are we! : None
Second Lord
4.3 :Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course : None
4.3 :of all treasons, we still see them reveal : None
4.3 :themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, : None
4.3 :so he that in this action contrives against his own : None
4.3 :nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself. : None
First Lord
4.3 :Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of : None
4.3 :our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his : None

Second Lord
4.3 :Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour. : None
First Lord
4.3 :That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see : None
4.3 :his company anatomized, that he might take a measure : None
4.3 :of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had : None
4.3 :set this counterfeit. : None
Second Lord
4.3 :We will not meddle with him till he come; for his : None

First Lord
4.3 :In the mean time, what hear you of these wars? : None
Second Lord
4.3 :I hear there is an overture of peace. : None

First Lord
4.3 :I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether : None
4.3 :of his council. : None
Second Lord
4.3 :Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal : None
4.3 :of his act. : None
First Lord
4.3 :Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his : None
4.3 :house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques : None
4.3 :le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere : None
4.3 :sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the : None
4.3 :tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her : None
4.3 :grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and : None
4.3 :now she sings in heaven. : None
Second Lord
4.3 :How is this justified? : None
First Lord
4.3 :The stronger part of it by her own letters, which : None
4.3 :makes her story true, even to the point of her : None
4.3 :death: her death itself, which could not be her : None
4.3 :office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by : None
4.3 :the rector of the place. : None

Second Lord
4.3 :I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this. : None
First Lord
4.3 :How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses! : None
Second Lord
4.3 :And how mightily some other times we drown our gain : None
4.3 :in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath : None
4.3 :here acquired for him shall at home be encountered : None
4.3 :with a shame as ample. : None
First Lord
4.3 :The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and : None
4.3 :ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our : None
4.3 :faults whipped them not; and our crimes would : None
4.3 :despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues. : None

Servant

BERTRAM
4.3 :I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a : None
4.3 :month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success: : None

4.3 :lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy; : None
4.3 :and between these main parcels of dispatch effected : None
4.3 :many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but : None
4.3 :that I have not ended yet. : None
Second Lord
4.3 :If the business be of any difficulty, and this : None
4.3 :morning your departure hence, it requires haste of : None
4.3 :your lordship. : None
BERTRAM
4.3 :I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to : None

4.3 :dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come, : None
4.3 :bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived : None
4.3 :me, like a double-meaning prophesier. : None
Second Lord
4.3 :Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night, : None
4.3 :poor gallant knave. : None
BERTRAM
4.3 :No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping : None
4.3 :his spurs so long. How does he carry himself? : None
Second Lord
4.3 :I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry : None
4.3 :him. But to answer you as you would be understood; : None
4.3 :he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he : None
4.3 :hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes : None
4.3 :to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to : None
4.3 :this very instant disaster of his setting i' the : None
4.3 :stocks: and what think you he hath confessed? : None
BERTRAM
4.3 :Nothing of me, has a'? : None
Second Lord
4.3 :His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his : None
4.3 :face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you : None
4.3 :are, you must have the patience to hear it. : None

PAROLLES
4.3 :Five or six thousand; but very weak and : None

First Soldier
4.3 :Shall I set down your answer so? : None

First Lord
4.3 :You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur : None

4.3 :Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say : None

PAROLLES
4.3 :Poor rogues, I pray you, say. : None
First Soldier
4.3 :Well, that's set down. : None

PAROLLES
4.3 :By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present : None
4.3 :hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a : None
4.3 :hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so : None
4.3 :many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, : None
4.3 :and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own : None
4.3 :company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and : None
4.3 :fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and : None
4.3 :sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand : None
4.3 :poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off : None
4.3 :their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces. : None
BERTRAM
4.3 :What shall be done to him? : None
First Lord

First Soldier
4.3 :Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour. : None
PAROLLES
4.3 :My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the : None

PAROLLES
4.3 :He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for : None
4.3 :rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he : None

4.3 :is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with : None
4.3 :such volubility, that you would think truth were a : None
4.3 :fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will : None
4.3 :be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little : None
4.3 :harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they : None
4.3 :know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but : None
4.3 :little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has : None
4.3 :every thing that an honest man should not have; what : None
4.3 :an honest man should have, he has nothing. : None
First Lord
4.3 :I begin to love him for this. : None
BERTRAM
4.3 :For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon : None

First Soldier
4.3 :What say you to his expertness in war? : None
PAROLLES
4.3 :Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English : None
4.3 :tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of : None
4.3 :his soldiership I know not; except, in that country : None
4.3 :he had the honour to be the officer at a place there : None
4.3 :called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of : None
4.3 :files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of : None
4.3 :this I am not certain. : None
First Lord
4.3 :He hath out-villained villany so far, that the : None

4.3 :A pox on him, he's a cat still. : None
First Soldier
4.3 :His qualities being at this poor price, I need not : None

PAROLLES
4.3 :Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple : None

Second Lord
4.3 :Why does be ask him of me? : None
First Soldier
4.3 :What's he? : None
PAROLLES
4.3 :E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so : None
4.3 :great as the first in goodness, but greater a great : None
4.3 :deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward, : None
4.3 :yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is: : None
